> The Congo Free State, also known as the Independent State of the Congo 
> (French: État indépendant du Congo), 
> was a large state and absolute monarchy in Central Africa from 1885 to 1908. 
> 
> It was privately owned by King Leopold II, the constitutional monarch of the Kingdom of Belgium. 
> In legal terms, the two separate countries were in a personal union. 
> The Congo Free State was not a part of, nor did it belong to, Belgium. 
> 
> Leopold was able to seize the region by convincing other European states 
> at the Berlin Conference on Africa that he was involved in humanitarian and philanthropic work 
> and would not tax trade. 
> 
> Via the International Association of the Congo, he was able to lay claim to most of the Congo Basin. 
> On 29 May 1885, after the closure of the Berlin Conference, 
> the king announced that he planned to name his possessions "the Congo Free State", 
> an appellation which was not yet used at the Berlin Conference 
> and which officially replaced "International Association of the Congo" on 1 August 1885. 
> The Free State was privately controlled by Leopold from Brussels; he never visited it.
>
> The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo 
> and existed from 1885 to 1908, 
> when the Belgian Parliament reluctantly annexed the state as a colony 
> belonging to Belgium after international pressure.
>
> Leopold's reign in the Congo eventually earned infamy 
> on account of the atrocities perpetrated on the Indigenous people. 
> Ostensibly, the Congo Free State aimed to bring civilization to the Indigenous people 
> and to develop the region economically. 
> 
> In reality, Leopold II's administration extracted ivory, rubber, 
> and minerals from the upper Congo basin for sale on the world market 
> through a series of international concessionary companies that brought little benefit to the area. 
> 
> Under Leopold's administration, 
> the Free State became one of the greatest international scandals of the early 20th century. 
> 
> The Casement Report of the British Consul Roger Casement 
> led to the arrest and punishment of officials 
> who had been responsible for killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903.
>
> The loss of life and atrocities inspired literature such as Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness 
> and raised an international outcry. 
> 
> Debate has been ongoing about the high death rate in this period. 
> The highest estimates state that the widespread use of forced labour, torture, 
> and murder led to the deaths of 50 per cent of the population in the rubber provinces. 
> 
> The lack of accurate records makes it difficult to quantify 
> the number of deaths caused by the exploitation 
> and the lack of immunity to new diseases introduced by contact with European colonists. 
> 
> During the Congo Free State propaganda war, 
> European and US reformers exposed atrocities in the Congo Free State to the public 
> through the Congo Reform Association, 
> founded by Casement and the journalist, author, and politician E. D. Morel. 
> Also active in exposing the activities of the Congo Free State was the author Arthur Conan Doyle, 
> whose book The Crime of the Congo was widely read in the early 1900s.
>
> By 1908, public pressure and diplomatic manoeuvres led to the end of Leopold II's absolutist rule; 
> the Belgian Parliament annexed the Congo Free State as a colony of Belgium. 
> It became known thereafter as the Belgian Congo. 
> 
> In addition, a number of major Belgian investment companies 
> pushed the Belgian government to take over the Congo 
> and develop the mining sector as it was virtually untapped.
